<PRE>Hi Matthias,

one more question about work flow and your paradigm
that there should be only one opened window/document
at a time.

Given the simple task of answering to an email, what I am doing
right now and what is possible in DeepaMehta.

With only one open window and the received email in the right detail
pane I would have to model all contents of the email on a topicmap
in the context pane to the left, possibly including the whole original text.
Then create the new &quot;answer email topic&quot; and open its detail pane
and write my answer based only on the information that is now
modeled in my context map.
Is this the way you are doing this ?

While I think this might be useful for very complex emails
I still cant imagine answering to what someone has written without
permanent access to the whole initial message.
With one window this would involve permanent context switches
aka &quot;mouse gazing&quot;.

Two windows, or in the old world a book and a notebook,
what is wrong about this?
Just one window is perfect for creative writing but in my opinion
not useful for the so called knowledge worker.
He/She would need either a huge amount of time for modeling
or a very well trained short time memory.

Maybe I am totally wrong, but this is how I am
working for the last 30 years and it seems hard change my mind.

Yours,
Torsten
