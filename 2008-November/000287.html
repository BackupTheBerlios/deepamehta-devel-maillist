<PRE>Bug #13827, was updated on 2008-May-18 00:07
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: DeepaMehta
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: x28
Assigned to : none
Summary: Deleted association still displayed

Details: Error scenario:
- created Topicmaps Test1 and Test2
- from Test1, created topics called Major, 1, 2, and 3
- associated 1, 2, and 3 to Major
- again from Test1, created topics 4 and 5 
- and associated them.

- In Test2, via search, revealed Major,
- via &quot;What's related&quot;, revealed 1, 2, and 3
- via search, revealed 4
- via &quot;what's connected&quot;, revealed 5.
- Then from Test2, connected 4 and 5 to Major, 
- then DELETED association between 4 and 5.

- in Test1, revealed the associations from 4 and 5 to Major, and everything shows correctly.
- In Test2, when asking &quot;What's related&quot; with 4, the result is correct: just topic Major
- BUT the visual map still shows two associations 
- when the association 4 to 5 is clicked, an error message shows:
  'Assiciation &quot;null&quot; can't execute command &quot;selectAssoc&quot; 
  (association &quot;a-1191-1&quot; not loaded)'

Comment:
i recognized this bug too and the current solution which worked for me is:

close the map i am working in and open it again out of my personal workspace.

no deleted associations are loaded again into your view.
