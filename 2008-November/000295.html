<PRE>Bug #13827, was updated on 2008-May-18 00:07
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: DeepaMehta
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: x28
Assigned to : none
Summary: Deleted association still displayed

Details: Error scenario:
- created Topicmaps Test1 and Test2
- from Test1, created topics called Major, 1, 2, and 3
- associated 1, 2, and 3 to Major
- again from Test1, created topics 4 and 5 
- and associated them.

- In Test2, via search, revealed Major,
- via &quot;What's related&quot;, revealed 1, 2, and 3
- via search, revealed 4
- via &quot;what's connected&quot;, revealed 5.
- Then from Test2, connected 4 and 5 to Major, 
- then DELETED association between 4 and 5.

- in Test1, revealed the associations from 4 and 5 to Major, and everything shows correctly.
- In Test2, when asking &quot;What's related&quot; with 4, the result is correct: just topic Major
- BUT the visual map still shows two associations 
- when the association 4 to 5 is clicked, an error message shows:
  'Assiciation &quot;null&quot; can't execute command &quot;selectAssoc&quot; 
  (association &quot;a-1191-1&quot; not loaded)'

Comment:
maybe this could be fixed, more or less easily. i am not totally sure. when following this idea some questions arise. like,

* should there be a notification or should it just happen, cause the owner of the topic decided so?
* if notification, should it be interactive ? (ask for keeping a private copy of this assoc/topic) and how could this look like?

maybe we could make use of the messaging connection, which delivers the current collaborative notifications. atm, users of a workspace are notified if maps are published into workspaces or chats are opened. if a topic or assoc is really deleted, then a message could go out to all connected clients (which is not nice) and some of the temporarily opened views may loose a visible object (or n visible objects).

what do you think..
* what do we need for this on server/client side? 
* how could a sufficient 1st step solution look like for the user?

the solution has at one side to meet the needs of a very collaborative environment and on the other side, the personal needs of a user regarding his view (have all visible objects under conrol).

Comment:
Thanks, Malte, for the workaround. However, the behavior contradicts the expectations raised by a philosophy that suggests that changes are always immediately effective without even saving some file!

i recognized this bug too and the current solution which worked for me is:

close the map i am working in and open it again out of my personal workspace.

no deleted associations are loaded again into your view.

Sorry, once more:
Error scenario:
- created Topicmaps Test1 and Test2
- from Test1, created topics called Major, 1, 2, and 3
- associated 1, 2, and 3 to Major
- again from Test1, created topics 4 and 5 
- and associated them.

- In Test2, via search, revealed Major,
- via &quot;What's related&quot;, revealed 1, 2, and 3
- via search, revealed 4
- via &quot;what's connected&quot;, revealed 5.
- Then from Test2, connected 4 and 5 to Major, 
- then DELETED association between 4 and 5.

- in Test1, revealed the associations from 4 and 5 to Major.
- When asking &quot;What's related&quot; with 4, the result is correct: just topic Major
- BUT the visual map still shows two associations 
- when the association 4 to 5 is clicked, an error message shows:
'Assiciation &quot;null&quot; can't execute command &quot;selectAssoc&quot; 
(association &quot;a-1191-1&quot; not loaded)'
