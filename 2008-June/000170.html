I think in topics of usability this feature would make sense in combination with 
a TimerTopic. Now Emails which are fetched are hard to reveal. Within this 
Feature Request, in my opinion, it would make sense to introduce TimeStamps 
and a TimerTopic which gets the current TimeStamp of it`s creation and a 
configuraion possibility of ranges like &quot;within the last 15minutes&quot; or &quot;within 
the last 5 minutes&quot; and show up all created topics (or just special ones) 
through a timestamp within this range. A notification would make sense, too. 
This could be extended to a TimerTopic Feature Request and it may be similar 
to this from gereby <A HREF="https://developer.berlios.de/">https://developer.berlios.de/</A>
feature/?func=detailfeature&amp;feature_id=3184&amp;group_id=5174.

update: 
* a Person Topic already has already a &quot;Compose Email To&quot; Command
* the send command has an icon already

Currently DeepaMehta's functionality for sending and receiving email 
is only rudimental. Possible improvements are:

- modell the sender and receiver as person-topics 
- a person should have a &quot;send mail to ...&quot; command
- notification of newly received mails
- personalization: a user should be able only to read his own mails
- the emails &quot;send&quot; command needs an icon
- IMAP support

The email feature needs a complete revision. The sourcecode is very 
old and written by programmers not in the project anymore. For the 
moment it's not even clear what is working and what is not.

This request is bound to people who want to explore the DeepaMehta 
framework (LiveTopic programming) as well as the Java-Mail API.
