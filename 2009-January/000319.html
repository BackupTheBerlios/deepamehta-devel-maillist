<PRE>Bug #14881, was updated on 2008-Dec-06 01:08
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: DeepaMehta
Category: Graphical Client
Status: Closed
Resolution: Fixed
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: jri
Assigned to : jri
Summary: File upload doesn't work when client runs as applet

Details: File upload doesn't work when client runs as applet. A warning appears: &quot;File xyz not uploaded because it is missing at client side&quot;.

However, file upload _does_ work when using the application client. The problem is with the applet client.

Comment:
Fixed in rev 361. Closed.

Notes:
All file operations (upload, download, open with application) work also, if the DeepaMehta client runs as applet. In particular, you can attach documents to emails. IMPORTANT: you must login via the signed applet and acknowledge the certificate.

A folder &quot;deepamehta-files&quot; is created in the home directory of your local machine. This directory acts as intermediate client-side file repository.

Issue 1: for the moment don't use spaces in file names. This is still a bug.

Issue 2: for the moment the file operations doesn't work if you run client and server at the same machine. However, the monolithic application works fine.

Please test the file operations and provide feedback. Functions in question are e.g. using document topics, open documents in local applications, share documents (a document is uploaded once a topic map is published), using custom topic icons, using custom topic map backgrounds, import topic maps, export topic maps. Probably there are still errors on certain platforms.
