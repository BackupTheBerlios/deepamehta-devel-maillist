<PRE>Bug #15098, was updated on 2009-Jan-21 18:14
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: DeepaMehta
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 7
Submitted by: jri
Assigned to : none
Summary: Broken network connections are not re-established

Details: This applies to client-server usage only: especially with Windows clients the communication links brake down at a regular basis. Currently the user must re-login to continue work. In most cases no data is lost, however this interruption is very annoying.

Timeout seems to be one issue here. For the moment, at the Java-level DeepaMehta explicitly disables the timeout for all sockets, but -- especially with Windows -- the operating system seems to have its own timeout policy.

In particular the messaging connection is affected, because it is used at a low frequency. One effect of a broken messaging connection: newly published topic maps are not immediately visible to the users.

Envisioned solution: if sending a command fails because of a broken network connection, the connection must be re-established and the command must be send again.
