Hallo,


ich bin gerade auf den Java Service Wrapper gesto&#223;en:

<A HREF="http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/">http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/</A>

Ich denke, dass sich mit dem Wrapper elegant einige DeepaMehta-Probleme
wie das Starten/Stoppen unter Linux/Windows usw. l&#246;sen lassen. Ich
h&#228;nge mal die About-Seite an.

Gr&#252;&#223;e,

ccm.


As with any application, reading through the documentation the best way
to get started. But realizing the desire to get your feet wet quickly,
you should glance over this page to get a feel for what the Wrapper can
do. 

Then to get up and running , at a minimum you will need to read over
the Integration Page. There you will be presented with 3 integration
methods. From the overviews, choose the one that best meets your needs
and then proceed to read over the page dedicated to that integration
method. 

The Wrapper provides a very large feature set. At some point it is
suggested that you look over the full properties list to get a feel for
the full power of the Java Service Wrapper. 

If you run into problems or have any questions, the preferred method
for getting help is posting a message to the wrapper-user mailing list. 

Introduction


The Java Service Wrapper is an application which has evolved out of a
desire to solve a number of problems common to many Java applications: 
Run as a Windows Service or Unix Daemon 
Application Reliability 
Standard, Out of the Box Scripting 
On Demand Restarts 
Flexible Configuration 
Ease Application Installations 
Logging 
  Run as a Windows Service or UNIX Daemon


The Wrapper makes it possible to install a Java Application as a
Windows NT Service. The scripts provided with the Wrapper also make it
very easy to install those same Java Applications as daemon processes
on UNIX systems. 

The Wrapper correctly handles user log outs under Windows, service
dependencies, and the ability to run services which interact with the
desktop. 

  Application Reliability


Application Reliability. As the use of Java expands, applications have
been written to provide a variety of mission critical services. These
services must be able to provide a high level of reliability. In an
ideal world, only software which is 100% bug free will ever be released
and installed. However, history has shown this not to be the case.
Almost every application suffers from quality issues at one point or
another during their life-cycle. Applications hang, crash, run out of
memory or suffer from any number of problems. Where possible, problems
are fixed quickly without significant service outages. There are times,
however, when fixing a problem can be prohibitively expensive or
impossible to solve in a short time period. 

The Wrapper monitors a JVM process and automatically restarts it if it
that the JVM has crashed or hung. This process takes just a few seconds
once the Wrapper has decided there is a problem. There is also a way to
configure the Wrapper to monitor the console output of a JVM and react
to certain strings by restarting or shutting down the JVM. 

While these features will not make every problem go away, they will
help you to sleep easier knowing that if there is a problem, the
Wrapper will be there to keep things up and running until you can get
into the office to check the logs. Say goodbye to that pager!! (Or as
so as not to date myself, that cel phone!) 

  Standard, Out of the Box Scripting


Write once run everywhere configuration. Java has been marketed as a
&quot;Write Once, Run Everywhere&quot; programming language. While this is true
for many aspects of an application, the developer is often plagued with
having to write complicated, platform specific scripts which are tasked
with building up class paths and collecting other system information
necessary to launch an application. 

The Java Service Wrapper helps to relieve the developer of this task by
providing a set of scripts for a wide range of platforms that can be
used as is to launch almost any Java Application controlled by the
Wrapper. 

The Wrapper moves all JVM configuration into a platform independent
configuration file. See the integration examples for details. 

  On Demand Restarts


The Wrapper provides a way for a Java Application to request that its
own JVM be restarted. This can be useful in a number of cases.
Applications may wish to restart after having had their configuration
files modified. Or the application may simply need to be restarted to
avoid problems with a memory or resource leak of some kind. 

JVM restarts can be triggered from within the JVM by making a call to
WrapperManager.restart(). See the Javadocs for more details. 

There are also more passive ways to trigger restarts. The Wrapper has
the ability to monitor console output and trigger shutdowns or restarts
whenever certain text is detected. 

The Wrapper can also be configured to either restart another JVM
instance or shudown normally depending on the exit code returned by a
JVM. 

  Flexible Configuration


The Wrapper provides a wide range of configuration properties which can
be used to configure the JVM in any way possible from the command line.
The Wrapper configuration file also provides a number of properties to
allow you configure things like logging and how the Wrapper is
installed as a service. 

See the Configuration Properties section for details on what is
possible. Be sure you have read over the integration section before
jumping into the configuration file. 

  Ease Application Installations


By using the Wrapper's standard scripts, and relative paths in the
configuration file, it is usually possible to create an application
which requires no further installation than simply expanding an archive
file into a directory of the user's choice. 

  Logging


While the Wrapper does not attempt to, nor should it, replace any of
the great logging tools available, it does provide a number of
properties to configure how stdout and stderr output to the JVM console
is handled. This output can be logged to any combination of the
console, a file, or the Event Log (Windows) or syslog (UNIX). 

Logging the output to the JVM console can be critical to tracking down
problems with an application. Without the Wrapper, when a JVM is being
run as a service under Windows, or as a daemon under UNIX, the console
output would normally be lost. The Wrapper makes sure that all console
output is logged. 

Java-based logging tools are only capable of logging output generated
from within the JVM. If the JVM crashes or prints out low level
messages such as thread dumps, there is normally no way to log it. The
Wrapper logs all console output from the JVM process regardless of its
source meaning that a record of any crash will survive even after the
Wrapper has restarted the JVM. 

See the Logging Configuration section for further details. 


Supported JVMs


The Wrapper is known to work with the Sun, IBM, Blackdown and BEA
WebLogic JRockit JVMs without any problems. If you get a chance to test
any other JVMs, please be sure and let us know the results. 
    NOTE MEG 
The Wrapper can be used with 1.2.x versions however some functions are
disabled due to this version of Java's lack of support for shutdown
hooks. Shutdown hooks were implemented with the 1.3.0 release of Java. 


Supported Platforms


Binary distributions are provided for the following list of platforms
and are available on the download page. 

Only OS versions which are known to work have been listed. If you have
had successful or unsuccessful results running on other OS versions,
please post a comment below and it will be added to the list. 

It should be fairly easy to build the Wrapper from source on additional
UNIX platforms. Please let us know and we will update the list. 

aix - AIX 

freebsd - FreeBSD 

hpux, hpux64 - HP-UX, 32 and 64-bit versions. 

irix - SGI Irix 

linux - Linux kernels; 2.2.x 2.4.x, 2.6.x. Known to work with Debian
and Red Hat, but should work with any distribution. Currently supported
on both 32 and 64-bit x86, and 64-bit ppc systems. 

macosx - Macintosh OS X. 

osf1 - DEC OSF1. 

solaris - Sun OS, Solaris 7, 8, 9 and 10. Currently supported on both
32 and 64-bit sparc, and x86 systems. 

win32 - Windows NT, 2000, XP, and 2003. 

Also known to run on Windows 98 and ME, however due the lack of support
for services in the OS, the Wrapper can only be run in console mode.
