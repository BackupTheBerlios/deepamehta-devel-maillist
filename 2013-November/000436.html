<PRE>Hi Malte,

&gt;<i> &gt; a) Show pictures/thumbnails per instance - e.g. a person (or any other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complex topic type) can have a picture. If picture exists, it is shown
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as a thumbnail on the canvas. Maybe you can use a thumbnail library
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which also displays thumbnails for various other mime types (PDF, DOC,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PNG, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that's a bit much to ask for now (&quot;any complex-type&quot;), mainly
</I>&gt;<i> because I can't even wrap my head around it (with picture you mean
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;File&quot;, right?). Maybe to concentrate an in-map &quot;Profile Picture&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> each &quot;User Account&quot; would be a first step?
</I>
Yeah ... it could be, but only if a more general approach would be much
harder. Because if I want to keep my car collection in DeepaMehta I want
to put a picture of every car that I have to each instance and I want to
see the thumbnail on the canvas. ;-) 

&gt;<i> And this thumbnail-library
</I>&gt;<i> things sounds a bit like a feature you want for all &quot;File&quot;-Topics, if I
</I>&gt;<i> get you right. Though I find this file content-preview thumbnails of
</I>&gt;<i> limited use in my day-to-day work (for example if compared to sorting
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Folder contents&quot; to &quot;Last modified&quot;).
</I>
Yes, exactly, for all files. But if this general approach for all kind
of file types is too difficult, let's just start with thumbnails of
fotos (png and/or jpg). I am pretty sure that a per instance thumbnail
picture of anything on the canvas will make DeepaMehta quite interesting
for very many new use cases. Let's just demo that, please!

Cheers,

JuergeN
