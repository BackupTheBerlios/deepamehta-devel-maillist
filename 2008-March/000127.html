<PRE>
Dear Developers,

thank you for your considerations about making DeepaMehta more 
attractive for external developers!

Please note: we already have javadoc-generated API documentation at the 
DeepaMehta website. Including call-references for important methods, a 
tweaked stylesheet to match the website design, handcrafted package 
comments and backlink to the DeepaMehta website. See &quot;Documentation -&gt; 
Developer Documentation -&gt; API Documentation&quot;.
www.deepamehta.de/docs/apidocs/

A lot of further documentation is found in the DeepaMehta source code 
itself. (Some people told me they have rarely seen a source code with 
such in-depth code documentation.) Of course there is -- as always -- 
room for improvement.

In my opinion the tool discussion is secondary and doesn't help here 
very much. For the time being the Javadoc tool does the job good 
enough. In the end the essential benefit is produced not by the tool 
but by the programmer who has the discipline and dedication to write 
well-thought code documentation (an art in itself). There helps nothing 
but practicing it.

An automatized nighty build of the API Docs AND Binaries is reasobale 
in principle but for the time being would not help too much people. 
Urs, i will not hesitate to create a shell account at the DeepaMehta 
server for you to be able to establish the nightly build process. But 
actually I would appreciate if you would focus on another 
high-priority-task in the same domain.

=&gt; In order to make DeepaMehta more attractive for external developers 
the most important task is to write a comprehensive DeepaMehta 
framework documentation. That is a documentation that deals at the 
conceptual level, above the API-level. The beginning of such a 
&quot;Development Guide&quot; is already available at the DeepaMehta website 
(Documentation -&gt; Developer Documentation -&gt; Development Guide) but 
apparently it is incomplete and would benefit from examples.
www.deepamehta.de/docs/devguide.html

Urs, I would appreciate very much if you're interested in 
extending/rewriting the DeepaMehta Development Guide resp. if you could 
motivate someone else to do so. Writing the DeepaMehta Development 
Guide could be an attractive challenge for technical writers who want 
to contribute to an innovative and ambitous open source project :-)

Regards,
J&#246;rg
