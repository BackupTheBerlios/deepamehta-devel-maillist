Hi Justin.

This sounds very interesting for the Community. We have
already thought about the powerful combination of the 
deepamehta  framework and delicious api. From our point of
view, your idea would be fitting perfectly to show up the
power of our framework.   When i get your point, the idea is
a  deepamehta  application which hooks into the provided
framework and combines the power of both. If you are
interested in a deeper  exchange of knowledge, feel free to
contact us again we would provide you with our support as
best as we can. Maybe we could exchange by voip or jabber to
get  in touch with the questions of such a concept. At the
moment we don&#180;t have the resources to implement your
application scenario. Even if the result would be a very
promising application.  

Hope it helps. I would be interested in getting to know your
software, in detail. If you want to checkout deepamehta as a
demo, feel free to contact me.

Kind regards, 

maltito

Hi.

I was just wondering if anyone would be interested in
adding a projected that we at Apphive.com have created
into DeepaMehta .

It is a simple Java application and the code could
probably be easily added into your project. 

What it does is simple. It takes your delicious
username and then processes you delicious bookmarks in
order to find those delicious users who have the most
bookmarks in common with you. The program then displays
these other delicious users to you and allows you to
view the rest of each users bookmarks to allow you to
find URLs of interest to you.

If this functionality was added to DeepaMehta in such a
way that links added to a mindmap would be used to find
other links to recommend to you to add to your mindmap
we feel this could be very interesting.

More interestingly though would be if the mind maps of
those users whose bookmarks are recommended where also
merged automatically with your mind map as you make it.
This could be done by putting a link to your mind map
at delicious.

If anyone find this interesting please email me at
