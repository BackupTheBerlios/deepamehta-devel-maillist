Summary: Better handling of result sets (DONATED feature)

This is the original specification of a DONATED feature:

For the moment revelation of result sets is cumbersome for 2 
reasons:
1) It is very unhandy (requires a lot of mouse action) to reveal topics 
one-by-one from a context-sub-menu.
2) The menu provides no hint which topics are revealed already.

Furthermore, usability-tests have proven it is not reasonable that, 
after searching, another operation is required (&quot;Show Result&quot;) to 
actually see the result (at least in case of result sets with more than 7 
topics).

There are 2 requirements:
1) a permanent visualiziation of the result set.
2) a possibility to reveal items from the result set very quickly.

Furthermore, an indication which items are already revealed might be 
helpful.

Conception of requested feature:
a) the &quot;Show Result&quot; command is dropped
b) instead the result set is listed in the property panel (the search 
topics, tons, get a new HTML-property: &quot;Result&quot;)
c) all items in the result set are rendered as hypertext links
d) clicking a link will reveal the topic (as before)
e) topics alreay revelaed should be marked some way in the list

[Update: issued b)-d) are realized in rev 335]

One further issue remains to be discussed: what about large result 
sets? The solution requested here:
- increase the current limit of 150 to, lets say 300 or 500.
- result sets below that limit may provide a &quot;Reveal all&quot; button.
Result sets beyond that limit are still not visualized, but a message 
that filtering is required.

A detail: a search topic (in fact any topic with extensive content) 
should remember its property panel scrollbar position. [Update: 
realized in rev 344]

Note: this feature request has been extracted from broader feature 
request #3055 (&quot;Reveal More&quot;).
