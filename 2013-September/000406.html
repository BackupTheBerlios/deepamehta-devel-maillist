Yes, Topicmaps must be of type &quot;dm4.topicmaps.topicmap&quot;. Currently there is no other way. Behind the scenes each topicmap is assigned a Topicmap Renderer implementation (identified by URI). The renderer implementation determines the topicmap's view model and (client-side) presentation logic.

DM provides no inheritance and probably never will.
Instead you can associate any type of child topics (simple or composite) to each topic/association instance. The FacetsService (see module dm4-facets) provides support to do so in a type-safe fashion.
To deliver certain facets along with a topic/association via the REST API you can use the server-side PreSend... hooks or the service response filter to enrich a topic/association on-the-fly.
	PreSendTopicListener 
	PreSendAssociationListener 
	PreSendTopicTypeListener 
	PreSendAssociationTypeListener
	ServiceResponseFilterListener

As an example see how the GeomapsPlugin provides a PreSendTopicListener to enrich all Address topics (that are topics of type &quot;dm4.contacts.address&quot;) that are delivered via REST with a Geo-Coordinate facet:

    /**
     * Enriches an Address topic with its Geo Coordinate facet.
     */
    @Override
    public void preSendTopic(Topic topic, ClientState clientState) {
        TopicModel address = findAddress(topic);
        if (address == null) {
            return;
        }
        //
        Topic geoFacet = facetsService.getFacet(address.getId(), &quot;dm4.geomaps.geo_coordinate_facet&quot;);
        if (geoFacet != null) {
            logger.info(&quot;### Enriching address &quot; + address.getId() + &quot; with its geo facet&quot;);
            address.getCompositeValueModel().put(&quot;dm4.geomaps.geo_coordinate&quot;, geoFacet.getModel());
        } else {
            logger.info(&quot;### Enriching address &quot; + address.getId() + &quot; with its geo facet ABORTED &quot; +
                &quot;-- no geo facet in DB&quot;);
        }
    }

&gt;<i> I thinks this might also be usefull to other parts of deepamehta,
</I>&gt;<i> for example the email plugin does use the dm4-contacts topictypes as
</I>&gt;<i> resources for email adresses. But there might be other usefull resources,
</I>&gt;<i> so a qualifier as &quot;this topictype provides an email address like xx standard topictype&quot;  might be usefull.
</I>
If a DM application needs to express the semantics &quot;email address&quot; it should use the topic type &quot;dm4.contacts.email_address&quot; (part of the dm4-contacts module) for that. Other modules can reuse this type for creating its domain specific types (like &quot;Person&quot; or &quot;Institution&quot;). Danny made the dm4-mail module flexible in the way the user can configure what domain specific types to be used for addressing an email. The only prerequisite is the type has a &quot;dm4.contacts.email_address&quot; as (direct or indirect) child-type.
Currently there is no Aliasing mechanism.

Cheers,
J&#246;rg
