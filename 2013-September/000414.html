<PRE>Hi J&#246;rg and all GUI developers,

I am about to implement a new click detection for my renderer
and seek for some advice, respectively am looking for a common
ground of my development and the default renderer.

Right now the click detection in the functions
find_topic_by_position and .._association_..
implements &quot;a a second drawing process&quot;
- all calculation is done over again on each mouse event
- possible all but one objects on the canvas have to be examined
- right now works only with rectangular bounding boxes of shapes
(clicking on the &quot;not painted corner&quot; of the standard note ball will
counted as click on the icon itself)
- topics are always preferred over associations
- topics first painted are preferred over the other ones in case of overlap
(without repecting that visibility is the other way round)

What I would like to implement:
- a lookup table to find the object without new calculations
- non rectangular areas to reflect the transparent portions of an icon,
or irregular shapes
- allow for certain areas of one topic to react differently to the mouse 
interaction
- allow more advanced detection of overlapped objects:
-- certain objects might know that its not them to react but the lower one
-- if unsure ask the user which one he/she tries to click
(as it is just so nasty to move a topic accidently over another and
suddenly you are not able to select it any more, but have to work your way
through the selectable ones till you reach the one you would like to 
have selected
in the beginning)

I see 2(3) ways to do this and here I would like your input:

1. using a muldimensional array to keep track of all the objects and 
desired action on the canvas
(object_canvas[x][y]=[{&quot;id&quot;:id,&quot;action&quot;:action},..] &lt;- each point holds 
an array of one or many object ids and actions,
empty points may be removed from the array ?speed vs. memory use?)
- on drawing each object registers itself to this array (object_id + 
action(show detail pane, start association, bring to front etc.))
- for unregular shapes or icons with alpha a helper function
-- is provided with the smallest possible bounding box that includes the 
object
-- does a bitmap compare of the canvas region bevore and after drawing
-- calculates the visible parts that should be registered in the array
- on a mouse event only the array has to be queried and all possible 
objects are directly accessible by lookup of their id

2. using the KineticJS (<A HREF="http://kinetikjs.com">http://kinetikjs.com</A>)
- implement the whole drawing and click detection using the kineticjs 
framework
- pro: less code as drawing, caching, event handling is allready 
implented (using a second canvas for hit detection)
- contra: overlapping objects are not supported, topmost rules

3. wait till browsers implement the HTML5 HitRegion
- this may take a while

Inspired by the KineticJS I would also like to look into caching of the 
objects,
if this makes sense for the yet simple objects.
It works the way that the object is drawn only once but then saved as an 
image that is
drawn to the canvas later on.

What do you think?
