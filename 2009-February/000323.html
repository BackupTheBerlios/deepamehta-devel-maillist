<PRE>Hey Ho,

further checking is warmly welcome and i look forward to help polishing
some of the below reported functionality but at the moment the _signed
applet_ at deepamehta.de is broken, for what kind of reason so ever.

for me of particular interest is to help with the latest enhancements
namely,

+ integrating image topics as attachments of emails, maybe everything
which derives from the topictype file, can be sent as attachment.
+ uploading big files or zip archives
+ opening documens to download them with gnome/kde ubuntu

cheers,
malte


--- Feedback to latest revision ---

Please test the file operations and provide feedback.

Functions in question are e.g.

using document topics

* uploading topics in ubuntu through dropping them into the file panel
works fine also sending mails with attached documents works fine on
deepamehta.de but this does not make a sound or anything. A Email is
sent if it can't be sent again, that's a hidden rule. In relation to
Emails, Image Topics should be considered as documents, too. A normal
user often sends images around, if you retype a image topic it goes not
into the document repository, workaround for that, may be renaming the
image before dropping it into dm

* I experienced a problem while uploading a zip archive with 1.8 MB of
size, its just not uploaded and the archive filename does not contain spaces

open documents in local applications

* doesnt work from ubuntu with a client server scenario connected to
deepamehta.de cause of missing &quot;.svg&quot; document type. but the type is
configured. my mime configuration is fine and assciated with an .svg
topic, nonetheless I get an error message, .svg cannont be opened cause
there is no document type .svg .. ??

share documents (a document is uploaded once a topic map is published)
since opening does not work, i don't know how to download them, with mac
users report success in opening and downloading a document

custom topic icons -&gt; seems not to work, urs was trying to share icons
with us, we don't see anything in a map.

using custom topic map backgrounds -&gt; are uploaded

import topic maps,
is working. don't know exactly what to test for

export topic maps,
* while using dm as a monolithic application, the export of a topicmap
just includes the files in the client-side repository, so not all
containing document topics are exportet into the zip-archive

* additional we could strip the path in the exported zip-archive from
&quot;/home/user/deepamehta-files/&quot; to just &quot;documents/&quot;
