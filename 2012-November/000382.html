<PRE>I just discovered after having to update to the latest changes to
implement the &quot;ACL-Entries workaround&quot; that my declarative migrations do
not apply anymore, so I wanted to let others know too:

a) uris' used in the declarative migration definitions for declaring
composite child topics do not use the &quot;part_topic_type_uri&quot; ref-anymore
but this needs to be rewritten to &quot;part_type_uri&quot; instead.

just in case you also need/want to update older plugins with declarative
migrations to be running with dm-4.0.13 and upwards.

note: afer digging throughout the outputs i just saw now, that this was
introduced in the ultimate commit (just a few hours ago) - well, that's
the hard side on always wanting to live on the edge.. :) always need to
double check when updating to latest &quot;master&quot; to not be surprised.

BTW: why is there in a &quot;dm4.core.composition_def&quot; no
&quot;whole_cardinality_uri &quot; needed as it is in a &quot;dm4.core.aggregation_def&quot;
? e.g.

    {
        part_type_uri:        &quot;dm4.accesscontrol.username&quot;,
        part_cardinality_uri: &quot;dm4.core.one&quot;,
        assoc_type_uri:       &quot;dm4.core.composition_def&quot;
    }


and another thing is

b) initalizePlugin (which danny is also using to fix the ACL-Entries
issue) seems to be unsupported now in a *Plugin Class, is there a
replacement yet?

cheers,
malt
