<PRE>Dear developers,

I would like to understand how I am able to create new (custom) topics
programmatically while being able to edit these instances later on
through the webclient (while being logged in as e.g. &quot;admin&quot;).

As I dont have a custom workspace in use, as the normal prerequisite I
associated all my custom topicTypes with the default workspace
DeepaMehta (&quot;de.workspaces.deepamehta&quot;). BTW: It would be nice if a
plugin could define some sort of default &quot;Workspace&quot; for all it's own
Topic- and AssociatonTypes.

Furthermore I related all newly created instances to the default
workspace through executing the following command in my Migration:

&lt;code&gt;

dms.createAssociation(new AssociationModel(&quot;dm4.core.aggregation&quot;,
    new TopicRoleModel(newTopic.getId(), &quot;dm4.core.whole&quot;),
    new TopicRoleModel(&quot;de.workspaces.deepamehta&quot;, &quot;dm4.core.part&quot;)
), null);

&lt;/code&gt;

Can one see if there's anything wrong with it, or explain if there is
something different I was not aware of yet? What else needs to be done
to not import topics which are editing wise &quot;locked&quot; contents.

Thankful for your help.

Greetings,
Malte

</PRE>
