I know you're very carefully with noting this down but because you're so
actively committing lots of stuff, for me the &quot;recent commit messages&quot;
are often nearly towards 100s of messages wich I would have the need to
read and I haven't thought/found about a way how to use &quot;grep &quot;BREAKING&quot;
over all your commit messages locally without &quot;pulling&quot; them before to
my workbench.

maybe working in another branch would allow me to do so, but github.com
sadly, despite its otherwise powerful search-mechanisms, does not allow
me to search just through all commit messages of your repo, thus the
following query does not yield any results:

<A HREF="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajri%2Fdeepamehta+%22BREAKING%22&amp;repo=&amp;p=1&amp;type=Everything&amp;l=">https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ajri%2Fdeepamehta+%22BREAKING%22&amp;repo=&amp;p=1&amp;type=Everything&amp;l=</A>

I am totally aware of that these are all issues arising just because of
my not really thought-out workflow.

And thanks for this pointer, exactly what I was looking for.
