Hi again,

I feel like I'm &quot;talking&quot; too much but ...

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've written a post explaining the steps of how to create a very

</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>Thank you for this great article! It provides a good help in making
&gt;<i> DM approachable for new developers! I appreciate the clear
</I>&gt;<i> language and structure as well as the handcrafted illustrations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While our personal &quot;hackership&quot;, which I enjoyed very much, I was
</I>&gt;<i> not always as clear/complete as I could have been. So here I like
</I>&gt;<i> to fill some of my gaps resp., relating to your article, suggest
</I>&gt;<i> some improvements:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Before the introducing quote you could say that DeepaMehta is
</I>&gt;<i> both, a *Webclient*, and an application development platform. (Most
</I>&gt;<i> of the quote relates to the Webclient while the remainder of the
</I>&gt;<i> article refers to the development platform).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The plugin directory name must not necessarily match the Maven 
</I>&gt;<i> artifact ID. You're free to choose any name. Anyway, it's not a
</I>&gt;<i> bad idea to let these names match.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - A migration does not only define the database schema. In general
</I>&gt;<i> a migration transforms the DB to ensure its structure and content
</I>&gt;<i> is compatible with your code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - For better readability the pom.xml contents could be indented.
</I>
The editor seems not to like xml indentation, so it gets rid of it,
I've done some trick, which is not too elegant but I've prioritized
readability

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - I would not say the project &lt;name&gt; is a description of the
</I>&gt;<i> project (which would be more verbose) but just, exactly as you
</I>&gt;<i> said, &quot;the human readable name of the plugin&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The &lt;groupId&gt; must not actually be a valid URL, but a globally 
</I>&gt;<i> unique name under which you collect the project's artifacts. To 
</I>&gt;<i> fulfill the &quot;globally unique&quot; requirement it is best practice to 
</I>&gt;<i> begin the name with a reversed domain name (as you've described).
</I>&gt;<i> You could use e.g. &quot;net.abriraqui.cgc-calendar&quot; as the group ID.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Generally in Maven the &lt;artifactId&gt; is the name of the generated 
</I>&gt;<i> .jar file (the Java binary). Within the group this name must be 
</I>&gt;<i> unique. Your choice (&quot;cgc-calendar&quot;) is a good one. (So, with the 
</I>&gt;<i> group ID suggested above &quot;cgc-calendar&quot; appears twice, which is
</I>&gt;<i> fine. That's because your project consist of only 1 artifact, but
</I>&gt;<i> in general there may be many). Remember: the artifact ID must not 
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily match the plugin's directory name. 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html">http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - I would not say relationships in DeepaMehta are *hypergraph* 
</I>&gt;<i> relationships. In a hypergraph a relationship can have more than 2 
</I>&gt;<i> ends. In DM it has always 2. Although one thing is special with
</I>&gt;<i> the DM data model: at a relationship's end there can be both: a
</I>&gt;<i> node (as usual), or a relationship (!). Anyway, if this structure
</I>&gt;<i> is equivalent to a hypergraph is an ongoing discussion (J&#252;rgen says
</I>&gt;<i> yes, I say no :-)
</I>
I wanted to check but actually I got those definitions from the wiki :-)

<A HREF="https://trac.deepamehta.de/wiki/TopicsAndAssociations">https://trac.deepamehta.de/wiki/TopicsAndAssociations</A>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - It is a convention in DM to use underscores in URIs instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> dashes. So it should be e.g. &quot;cgc.calendar.start_date&quot;. (While our 
</I>&gt;<i> hackership I told differently.)
</I>
nice, like in Rails, so I won't get crazy about naming :-D

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - A type's &quot;value&quot; property is its (human readable) *name*, not 
</I>&gt;<i> actually a &quot;description&quot; (which would possibly more verbose).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - I would talk about &quot;Event&quot;, &quot;Start Date&quot;, and &quot;End Date&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> *Topic Types* (instead of Topics). The distinction is like in OO: a
</I>&gt;<i> type is like a *class* while a topic is like an *instance* of a
</I>&gt;<i> class. However, it is technically correct to talk of DM Types as
</I>&gt;<i> Topics, because in DM Type is derived from Topic. But the more
</I>&gt;<i> specific term might make things more clear for the reader
</I>&gt;<i> (especially if she is familiar with OO).
</I>
This is something that I sensed but  was not sure, so it could be
added to the users guide ;-)

<A HREF="https://trac.deepamehta.de/wiki/TopicTypesAndAssociationTypes">https://trac.deepamehta.de/wiki/TopicTypesAndAssociationTypes</A>

&gt;<i> - The plugin.properties file should contain a 2nd line: 
</I>&gt;<i> importModels=de.deepamehta.webclient This declares your plugin
</I>&gt;<i> makes use of the DM Webclient data model (namely its type 
</I>&gt;<i> dm4.webclient.view_config). DM then takes care the Webclient is 
</I>&gt;<i> installed *before* the Calendar plugin. However, this is only of 
</I>&gt;<i> importance if Calendar is installed along with DM (e.g. when you 
</I>&gt;<i> publish a custom DM distro). While our hackership I omitted that 
</I>&gt;<i> setting.
</I>
&gt;<i> - In the latter code examples indentation is a bit out of place.
</I>
yes, same problems with indentation :-(

&gt;<i> - At the article end: you should say that this configuration goes
</I>&gt;<i> to DM's &quot;global&quot; pom.xml. This is found at the top-level of its
</I>&gt;<i> home directory.
</I>
ups yes, I forgot to specify that

&gt;<i> Hmh, I feel little like a rigid schoolmaster now ;-) Your article
</I>&gt;<i> is great!
</I>
on the contrary, thanks a lot for taking the time!!

best wishes for 2014 :)
