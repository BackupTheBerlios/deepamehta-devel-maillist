No. For 3rd-party DM clients the least common denominator is the RESTClient.

The DM Webclient's model classes (Topic, Association, TopicmapViewmodel) are specific to it. E.g. the TopicmapViewmodel includes a single-object selection model. Your client might support multiple-object selection.

However, your client might be able to use the DM Webclient's model classes to a certain degree by mocking the global dm4c object the model classes rely on:

	dm4c = {}
	dm4c.restc = new RESTClient()

Note: this is not officially supported. Try it on your own.

&gt;<i> How does the RestClient know where to connect?
</I>
The RESTClient is AJAX based. So it connects to the same host and port it was loaded from. JavaScript's same-origin policy applies. Your client's main HTML page which embeds the RESTClient must be served from a DM plugin.

Cheers,
J&#246;rg
